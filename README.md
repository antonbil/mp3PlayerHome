mp3PlayerHome
Android app which combines three things:
- front-end to mpd
- front-end to mopidy
- browse through smb-share that holds shortcuts to directories of mpd

The entire program is album-based.
Easy to browse through directories, artists and albums.

It is useful for large lists of albums, that are split up in directories for convenience.

The back-end is based on a few raspberry pi's, that run mpd, mopidy and samba.
